# landing

I had a lot of fun during this build week! Overall, I would say build week helped me to string together all that I learned during my time at Lambda.  I also learned a lot about design by working on this project.

I have two different HTML files for the project - my index.html file is for the marketing webpage while the aboutUs.html file is for the webpage that discusses the team responsible for the creation of the project.

I used a less compiler to create the styling for both webpages. The less files for each webpage are grouped together and are named according to how they relate to the webpage. Some less files are used in both webpages (such as the navBar.less and footer.less files) while others are unique to each page (such as the secondBodyIndex.less and secondBodyAboutUs.less files).  Components such as the carousel and menu also have their own less files.  The index.less file imports all of the less files into a single file to be watched by the compiler.

I constructed two different components for this project.  The carousel was constructed after watching a youtube tutorial (see, “How To Create An Image Slider In HTML, CSS & Javascript” published by Dev Ed on Youtube) while the dropdown menu was created using information that had been taught during class at Lambda School. The carousel that I built has a bug that breaks the component when the viewport is changed beyond a breakpoint that has been set in CSS. Beyond this bug, the component appears to function as intended. Even though this bug may prevent me from using this particular component in the future, I did learn a lot of CSS and JS from this tutorial and would recommend it to anyone who is new to building JS components.  The menu component that I built functions just as it had when I learned it during class at Lambda. Between both components, the code for this website creates objects, uses an array method, uses event listeners, and manipulates the DOM as was specified in the grading rubric for the project .

Responsive design was implemented throughout my portion of the project. I took care to make sure that both of my webpages looked professional on all mobile viewports available by default within Google Chrome’s developer tools.

During this build week, I built a lot of confidence in my skills as a developer.  I look forward to doing it again in five weeks!
