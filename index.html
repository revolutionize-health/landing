                <p>At Revolutionize Health, we empower you with the information necessary to make informed healthcare
                    decisions. Most Americans receive healthcare without knowing what their out of pocket costs will be
                    for the services that they receive. This uncertainty can lead to unnecessary stress at a time when
                    your body needs to heal. Focus on what's important and leave the rest to us.</p>

                <p>With Revolutionize Health, you can get the care you need when you need it. Too many people put off
                    live-saving healthcare services because of unknown costs. Whether it be preventive care, routine lab
                    work, a major operation, or treatment for a chronic illness, Revolutionize Health will help you
                    choose the option that's best for you.</p>

                <p>Whether you have insurance or not, the cost of healthcare can be extremely high, often resulting in
                    excessive debt and financial stress. With Revolutionize Health, we allow you to find the best
                    possible healthcare at the lowest price based on your life situation. By crowdsourcing information
                    from our users, Revolutionize Health allows you to save money by providing the information you need
                    in a quick, easy to understand format. </p>

                <h2>How Revolutionize Health Works</h2>
                <p>Revolutionize Health works by aggregating crowdsourced information from our users. By collecting
                    information from our users regarding the cost of specific medical procedures at particular
                    providers, Revolutionize Health is able to provide average healthcare costs over a wide variety of
                    different circumstances. Revolutionize Health also collects data regarding an individual's insurance
                    status. Collecting this information allows us to provide an estimate of how much a medical procedure
                    will cost with different insurance plans or with no insurance plan at all.</p>
